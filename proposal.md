# aRt: Recreating Art With R

## Description
This project aims to recreate art pieces using R

## Motivation
This project serves as a research group to help us learn more about R, art, and their intersection. We aim to dive deeper into the visual side of data visualization and explore the advanced usage of shapes and colors through recreating artworks with R code. We hope that it will allow us to get better at creating complex and visually appealing plots, as well as draw a stronger connection between our technical and artistical sides. Moreover, as we are not the first ones to attempt creating art using R, we also hope to gain insights from the relevant packages created by the community.
